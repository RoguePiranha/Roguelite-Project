# **Game Idea**

- Roguelite
- Merge abilities/spells/items? (ie combining bow with fireball spell gives bow that shoots magic fire arrows, allow weird combos like bow with shield gen item traps hit enemy in shield bubble) the more combos the better
- RPG style leveling
- Different combat options (ranged, mid, close, spells, bows, swords, daggers, hand-to-hand)
- Armor and items
- Top-down
- character builder with stat points before game and ability selection

## Unlockables

- Race (Human -> Manaborn, Start as human, elf, or Dwarf and unlock other races in playthrough)
- Classes (Wizard -> Pyromancer or cryomancer or necromancer(needs max follower count))
- Abilities
- Library of items and spells that have been discovered with descriptions
- Endless after winning level mode

## Character Builder

- Create Save Slot (Can save multiple characters. Each save slot will be unique so players can start fresh without losing their old character)
- Choose species (human, elf, dwarf, orc, etc) {Maybe add option to create custom species?} (each species has different stat bonuses and abilities)
  - Stat point effect is multiplied by species bonus (ie. orcs get 1.25x strength bonus, but -0.5x intelligence bonus)
  - Species can be evolved into a new species after certain conditions are met (ie. orc can evolve into ogre after killing a certain number of enemies or something)
- Can opt to choose a class (This affects what abilities you have available to start and the gear you start with)
  - highlight suggested stats and abilities based on class choice
  - Can choose to ignore class and set stats and abilities as desired (ie. warrior with high intelligence and wisdom)
  - Class gives starting gear and starting ability options
  - new starting abilities are unlocked during gameplay and can be swapped out after game over, gear is lost on death and each new game starts with new gear
- Choose ability (Max based on species)
- Choose stats (10 points to distribute)
- Choose name
- Save Character as template, can be used and adjusted in future games

## Stats

## Leveling

- Spells and abilities level with use/ actions, player levels up primarily with kills.
  - Maybe gets some xp for merging things and leveling spells.
  - Not sure how abilities would level as they are passive.
    - Maybe they level with use? (ie. ***Fire Affinity*** levels with fire spell use?)
- Spells can evolve with level, choices offered for spell growth direction
- Combining spells creates spell at lowest of two used, increase in rarity of spell always yields level 0 spell
- Items have no level, combining with spell affects rarity, applies rarity between two used. Ie, common+rare yields uncommon, common+uncommon yields uncommon. Maybe assign point value to items to that effect? Ie, 1-5 is common, 6-10 is uncommon. Common 2 + Uncommon 6 is Common 4.

## Gameplay

- Top-down view
- Large Open World
- Omni-directional movement and aiming
- Defeating floor boss will unlock next floor via portal
- Start with basic gear and abilities
- Find new gear and abilities in chests, from enemies, or from trainers
- Set number of floors, can continue with procedurally generated floors after final floor
- Each level increases difficulty by increasing enemy health and damage, item rarity increases based on floor number
- NPCs appear less frequently as floor number increases and in smaller and smaller towns or villages
- Chunk environment affects spell power ie fire is weak in rain, water is weak in volcano
- A few key item slots that rotate equipped with wheel scroll or number keys. (Similar to Fortnite)
  - As items and spells are found, they can be equipped in these slots.
  - If you have an item or spell equipped in a slot and find a new one, you can choose to swap, combine, or send to inventory.
- End of game stats screen after death: kills, damage dealt, damage received, etc.
