# USE THIS TEST VERSION FOR MAKING UPDATES BEFORE APPLYING TO MAIN GAME FOLDER

As we work through issues in discovering how different scripts and processes interact with each other,
there will be many mistakes that will be made. I have made plenty myself. In order to relieve some of
that pressure and hopefully to make the development process go more smoothly, I suggest that we use
this game folder for development and only move scripts and other files over to the main game once they
have been tested and somewhat finalized.

Obviously, things will change as we continue to develop, but this should allow us to have better version
control and avoid making time consuming mistakes.
